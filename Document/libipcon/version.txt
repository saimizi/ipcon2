How to specify libipcon version 

Following rules of libtool version system.

Reference 1: https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html
Reference 2: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=19553

Version is specified in lib/Makefile.am as "--version-info" with a format of
following
	'Current [:Revision[:Age]]'

The x, y, z in libipcon-x.y.z will be caculated as
	x = C - A	
	y = A
	z = R

Version update rules (copied from Reference 1 above):

1. Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.
2. Update the version information only immediately before a public release of
   your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that
   the current interface number gets larger faster.
3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then
   increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).
4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update,
   increment current, and set revision to 0.
5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
   increment age.
6. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public release,
   then set age to 0.
