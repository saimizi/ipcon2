Coding style

It is difficult to define a coding style though it is an very important thing.
Thankfully there are many very excellent coding styles distributed in OSS, such
as linux kernal coding style. so the simplest way is to divert it.:) 


DESCRIPTION
------------

One reason of using linux kernel coding style is that it is practicable and less
redundants. 8 character tab and 80 column rules make the code easy to read
and often give you a chance to review the program design. If there are codes
difficuclt to satisfy these two rules, often they are better to be reviewed
again.

The description of linux kernel coding style can be found in the
Documentation/CodingStyle of the linux kernel source tree. I copied one from
linux-3.18.24 source tree to the tool/linux_script. You can also refer to it
from there.

Especially, please pay attention to wrting comment in the source code. It is
a very stupid thing to write a lot of comments to describe something which is
obvious from the source code itself. Reading "Chapter 8 Commenting" of the linux
coding style is strongly recommended.


TOOL
------------

Also there is a tool provided by linux kernel to check the coding style of the
source code. It is very helpful.

$ code_check test_main.c
test_main.c:10: WARNING: line over 80 characters
test_main.c:10: WARNING: please, no space before tabs
test_main.c:10: ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
test_main.c:10: ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
test_main.c:10: ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
test_main.c:13: ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
test_main.c:13: ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
test_main.c:13: ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
test_main.c:13: ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
test_main.c:13: ERROR: space required after that ',' (ctx:VxV)
test_main.c:13: WARNING: externs should be avoided in .c files
...
total: 293 errors, 74 warnings, 438 lines checked

code_check is just a wrapper to the original linux kernel tool checkpatch.pl
which you can also find in the script directory of the linux kernel source tree.

Ofcourse both CodingSytle document and check tool from linux kernel follow the
liscense of linux kernel (GPLv2). please referto linux_script/COPYING for
detais.
